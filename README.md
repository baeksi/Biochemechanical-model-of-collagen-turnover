# Biochemechanical-model-of-collagen-turnover
This is source code based on Tilahun, Mullagura, Humphrey and Baek's BMMB paper.

Biochemomechanical approach to model subcellular synthesis of procollagen as well as
its transition from an intermediate state of self-assembled microfibrils to matured cross-linked fibers with mechano-regulated removal

Theoretical reference: "A Biochemomechanical Model of Collagen Turnover in Arterial Adaptations to Hemodynamic Loading",by H.Tilahun, H,N. Mullarura, J.D.Humphrey, S.Baek

Main changes:
		- rewriten from C to C++
		- organized to modulus and functions
		- added or removed some comments

This is one of original Tilahun's matlab codes and Mullagura made an edit of the matlab code that matched the model parameter names to those in the revised paper. Mullagura also tested both of C++ and Matlab code, added a parameter sensitivity analysys (shown in Supplementary Document), and has verified the C++ code with the Matlab code.
